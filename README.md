# Sorting Algorithm Visualization using Matplotlib

This project visualizes different sorting algorithms using Matplotlib animations. It provides a step-by-step representation of how sorting algorithms work by updating the bars in real-time.

## 📜 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

✔️ Bubble Sort

✔️ Selection Sort

✔️ Insertion Sort

✔️ Merge Sort

✔️ Quick Sort

## 📌 How It Works

Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation is used to update the bars dynamically.

Sorting steps are stored as frames and played in sequence.

Each sorting step updates the height of bars to reflect the current state of the array.


## ⚠️ Limitations

❌ Not optimized for large datasets (1000+ elements) – performance may slow down
